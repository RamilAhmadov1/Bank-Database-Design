# BankDatabase-Design
 
I designed and managed the Bank Database system using SQL Developer for bank database systems. The project illustrates the construction of a database system within the banking domain, highlighting its complex design due to extensive data. My goals include creating a fundamental database scheme, highlighting the general appearance and data relationships in the bank database, and ensuring overall project smoothness. 


The project centers around the Bank database system and design, comprising 9 tables: Accounts, Bank, Branches, Customers_Accounts, Customers, Employees, Loan, Loan_Customer, and Transaction. Notably, Customers_Accounts and Loan_Customer serve as intersection tables.  
Personally generated around 75% of the added data for the project, while the remaining 25% was obtained from Mockaroo. This approach was chosen to ensure unique and specific data, which is challenging to achieve with general data from Mockaroo. For instance, I manually created unique data for a branch located in California, including street, phone number, and other California-related details. All data, whether manually entered or imported from Mockaroo, is fictional, with no real persons, bank names, branches, or account numbers. The bank name is purely imaginative, and the table/data sequence does not mirror any actual bank's database.
